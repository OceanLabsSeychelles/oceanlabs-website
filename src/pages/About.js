                        <p>OceanLabs Seychelles can be summarized as our drive to grow the
                        unique engineering culture of Seychelles, aligned to our
                            environment while at the same time on par with global standards.</p>
                        <p>Our engineering skills are focused on marine and environmental
                        remote sensing projects, as well as Internet of Things projects,
                        for Seychellesâ€™ agricultural sectors, industries, organisations and
                        governmental units.</p>
                            <p> We aim for the design and use of appropriate technology, suited
                        to our climate, infrastructure and the needs of our society and
                        environment</p>
